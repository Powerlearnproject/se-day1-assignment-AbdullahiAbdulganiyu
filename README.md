#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the developement and maintanance of high-quality software systems. 

Software engineering is very important in the technology industry because it plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life which include: communication, commerce, entertainment, healtcare, etc.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Three key milestone in the evolution of software engineering include:
1. Developement of programming languages.
2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline.
3. The rise in agile methodologies in the 2000s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The phases of Software Development Life Cycle includes:

1. Requirement.
2. Design.
3. Implementation.
4. Testing.
5. Deployment.
6. Maintenance.

1. Requirement: This involves gathering and documenting the user's needs and system requirements.
2. Design: This involves creating high-level and detailed design of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation: This involves writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing: This is the phase at which various test are conducted on the software to ensure that the software meets quality standard and functional requirement.
5. Deployment: This is the phase at which the sofware is released to users or consumers.
6. Maintenace: This is the phase at which support updates are provided and the softwares are being enhanced after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology is a linear, sequential approach to the software dvelopment life cycle.just like the scenerio of rainfall which is sequential and linear

while

Agile methodology is an iterative, incremental appraoch to the sofware development life cycle. just like in the scenerio of open heart suggery.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

The roles and responsibilties of 
1. Software Develpoer includes: writing codes, implementation of software solutions.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer includes: ensuring software quality by designing and executing test plans.
3. project Manager includes: overseeing the planning, execution, and delivery of the software project.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

1. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. E.g Visual Studio.
2. Version Control Systems (VCS) are tools for tracking changes to the source code and coordinating work among team members. E.g Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Some challenges that are faced by software engineers include: 
1. Changing Requirements.
2. Tight Deadlines.
3. Technical Debt.

Some strategies to overcome the challenges include:
1. Effective communication.
2. Applying the Agile Methodology
3. Prioritizing tasks.
4. Regular reassessment of the project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Types of testing 
1. Unit testing: It involves testing individual component or module of software.
2. Integration testing: It involves testing interaction between different components or subsystems.
3. System testing: It involves testing the entire software system as a whole.
4. Acceptance testing: It involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering can be described as the process of crafting questions or statements to get the best possible response from AI models.
One of the major importance of prompt engineering is that it helps to improve interaction between humans and AI.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

A vague prompt could be:
How can i build a house
It can be improved thus:
I want to build a house with two rooms, each room should be able to accomodate two people and the house in meant to be built in Nigeria. what are the step i would need in building the house.

The improved prompt is more effective because it is more clear, specific and precise
